## Objectives

* Apply Hough transform for detecting parametric shapes like circles and lines.
* Apply Harris operator for detecting corners.

## Deadline

**Thursday 26/3/2020 11:59 PM**

## Joining to Assignment Repository
Refer to this sheet to know your **Group number**: (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H0mGNnDtruLanYVxQH6439rXLTpPglXzglBmYt1J_ow/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Register your team in the assignment through https://classroom.github.com/g/pLAsu9oN. 

2. Join your team that you already worked with in the previous assignment



## Deliverables

You will start working from the source code you delivered for previous task.

Only one member in each team will do the following:

1. First, copy the remote url of the newly generated repository.

2. From the folder of the previous repository, upload the source to the new repository.
For example, for team SBE404-2020-Team01, in the folder of the previous task, the responsible member may run the following command:
`git push git@github.com:sbme-tutorials/cv404-2020-assignment-02-sbe404-2020-team01.git master -u`

Now you will find your work of the previous task uploaded to the new repository. Now clone the new repository in an independent folder.



### A) Computer Vision Functions

You need to implement Python functions which will support the following tasks:

1. For all given images; detect edges using Canny edge detector, detect lines and circles located in these images (if any). Superimpose the detected shapes on the images.

2. For given images; initialize the contour for a given object and evolve the Active Contour Model (snake) using the greedy algorithm. Represent the output as chain code and compute the perimeter and the area inside these contours.
You should implement these tasks **without depending on OpenCV library or alike**.


Add new Python files to organize your implementation of the core functionalities:

1. `CV404Hough.py`: this will include your implementation for Hough transform for lines and circles (requirement 1).
2. `CV404Harris.py`: this will include your implementation for Harris operator for corners detection (requirement 2)

### B) GUI Integration

Integrate your functions in part (A) to the following Qt MainWindow design:
